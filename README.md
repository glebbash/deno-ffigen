# deno-ffigen - FFI Bindings generator for Deno

This tool will create typesafe bindings for a C library. You just need to
provide a C header file and shared library file.

## Status

**EXPERIMENTAL**

Bindings generation tested for:

- LLVM-C, versions (14, 15)
- sqlite3
- lua 5.4

Testing deno-ffigen includes building bindings for all libraries in
[examples](./examples/) folder, so they will always be working and up to date.

Try it out if you have a C library that you want to have bindings for, if it
doesn't work you can submit a PR adding your setup to examples folder, and
hopefully we can update ffigen to support your case.

Supported features by OS:

| Feature                   | Linux            | OS X | Windows |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---- | ------- |
| Exposed symbol extraction | + (uses readelf) | -    | -       |
| c2ffi symbol extraction   | +                | -    | -       |
| Generated libs target     | +                | +    | +       |

Note: Due to C not being crossplatform, generated bindings might not work on
platforms that differ from the one extracting symbols.

But, if the library that you are generating bindings for exposes the same
functions for all targets, and does not have OS and architecture specific types
then bindings generated on Linux should work on all platforms.

## Prerequisites

- [deno](https://deno.land/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) - for using c2ffi without building it from
  source

## Usage

There are 2 usage variants:

- build script (recommended)
- manual steps and cli (for simple cases)

## Usage: Build script

Create a `build.ts` file that uses `deno-ffigen` API.

You can find all example build scripts in `examples` folder:

- [llvm-14](https://deno.land/x/ffigen@v0.2.1/examples/llvm-c-14/build.ts)
- [sqlite3](https://deno.land/x/ffigen@v0.2.1/examples/sqlite3/build.ts)
- [lua](https://deno.land/x/ffigen@v0.2.1/examples/lua/build.ts)

Run it using:

```bash
deno run -A build.ts
```

## Usage: Manual steps + cli

Following sections assume that [[C_LIB]] is the name of the library you are
generating bindings for.

### Extract definitions from [[C_LIB]].h

```sh
docker run -v $(pwd):/data glebbash/deno-ffigen-c2ffi /data/input/[[C_LIB]].h > input/[[C_LIB]].json
```

This will use prebuilt docker image of [c2ffi](https://github.com/rpav/c2ffi) to
generate `input/[[C_LIB]].json` file containing all symbols found in
`input/[[C_LIB]].h`.

### Extract symbols from [[C_LIB]].so

```sh
readelf -Ws --dyn-syms input/[[C_LIB]].so > input/[[C_LIB]]_symbols.txt
```

This will generate `input/[[C_LIB]]_symbols.txt` file containing names of all
exposed symbols of `input/[[C_LIB]].so`.

## Generate bindings

```sh
deno run -A https://deno.land/x/ffigen/cli.ts \
  --definitions input/[[C_LIB]].json \
  --symbols input/[[C_LIB]]_symbols.txt \
  --headers [[HEADERS_BASE_URL]] \
  --lib-name [[LIB_NAME]]
```

Using `input/[[C_LIB]].json` and `input/[[C_LIB]]_symbols.txt` as inputs
deno-ffigen generates the following files:

- `[[LIB_NAME]]/mod.ts` - Bindings entry that also dlopens the shared lib
- `[[LIB_NAME]]/types.ts` - Namespace with all type/enum/function definitions
- `[[LIB_NAME]]/symbols.ts` - Exports object with lib definition for
  `Deno.dlopen`
- `[[LIB_NAME]]/safe-ffi.ts` - Type utils for making pointers typesafe

For all the available options run

```bash
deno run -A https://deno.land/x/ffigen/cli.ts --help
```

##Â Mac OSX Users

This software requires [`readelf`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/readelf.1.html) to be installed. As this is a Linux tool, there is a workaround for MacOSX users.

1. `brew install binutils`

which will provider you with `greadelf` with is equivalent.

_Note_ - You will need to use the `.so` linux shared library, rather than the equivalent `.dylib` osx dynamic library.
